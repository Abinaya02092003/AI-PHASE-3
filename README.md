## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System - Phase 3! This project is aimed at building a simple yet effective machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes. This README will guide you through the installation, usage, and customization of the system.

## 2. Features

- **Diabetes Prediction**: The system uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on a set of input features.
- **Easy-to-Use**: The system is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible for both developers and non-developers.
- **Customization**: You can easily customize the system by adding more data, fine-tuning the model, or adapting it to specific use cases.
- **Phase 3 Enhancements**: This version includes improved data preprocessing, a more accurate model, and enhanced documentation.

## 3. Installation

To get started with the AI Basic Diabetes Prediction System, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git
   cd ai-diabetes-prediction-phase3
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python (version 3.7 or higher) installed on your system. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preparation**:
   Prepare your data for model training or testing. You can use your own dataset, or refer to the [Data Collection](#data-collection) section for information on available datasets.

4. **Model Training**:
   Train the model using your data, or you can use the pre-trained model available in the `models` directory.

5. **Run the System**:
   To run the system and predict diabetes, use the provided scripts. Details are available in the [Usage](#usage) section.

## 4. Usage

Once the system is installed, you can use it to predict diabetes for individuals. Here are the basic usage instructions:

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**:
  To predict diabetes using the CLI, run:
  ```bash
  python predict.py --input input_data.csv
  ```
  Replace `input_data.csv` with the path to your input data.

- **API**:
  You can also use the API for predictions. Start the API by running:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
  The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`. You can make POST requests to this URL with your input data in JSON format to get predictions.

## 5. Model Training

If you wish to train the model with your own data, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset following the format used in the `data` directory.

2. Train the model using the provided scripts or your preferred machine learning framework.

3. Save the trained model in the `models` directory.

## 6. Data Collection

If you need data for your diabetes prediction system, you can refer to the following sources:

- [CDC National Diabetes Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/index.html)
- [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## 7. Contributing
